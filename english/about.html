        <p>The festival does not have a competitive character and its goal is to show films by as many creators as possible. There will be no cost for submitting a film or attending the festival! Interested parties and participants can be informed about the developments and news of the festival on this site but also from the festival page on Facebook and Instagram  </p>

        <h2>A few words about us</h2>

        <p>The Cinema Team of the Cultural Groups of the Students of the University of Patras (POFPP) is a group of students but not only, which aspires to bring to the surface the artistic concerns of each individual, through the cinema. The aim of the group is for the members to share their interest and knowledge about cinema and to encourage people with artistic concerns to express themselves through it.</p>

        <p>Meetings are held on a weekly basis at POFPP's art-space, with a focus on the technical and artistic parts of the film production process. Special regard is also given to the discussion and exchange of views on films.</p>

        <p>Also, one of the main activities of the group is film screenings. In winter, the screenings take place at the same POFPP art-space every week. Also, every year, summer and autumn screenings take place on the steps of Agios Nikolaos, offering an alternative proposal for the evenings of the residents of Patras.</p>
